Cell in a box
=============

This is a simple implementation of a phase field model describing a single cell in a one-dimensional box.
This is an example solution to the exercise proposed in <https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05557>.

Instructions
------------

The code is written in python and dependencies can easily be setup using a virtual environment as follows:
```bash
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once the requirements have been installed, the code can be run by typing:
```bash
python exercise.py
```
Note that depending on your local matplotlib installation you'll need to set the default backend.
